TODO LIST:
	flesh out combat - different attacks - kick - punch - block - throw - counter - all of these in air as well
	flesh out damages and health for player
	make different types of enemies - stationary - moving - flying - jumping - main style bad guys -- tube pirates?
	clean up game directory
	talking - things you can walk up to and see what they say
	

sort out the knock player and give damage functions. it should be either both at once or neither.
If an enemy can't give damage then it shouldn't knock the player back.

try making punch and kick bigger and adding a bit of forward motion with them to see how it feels
