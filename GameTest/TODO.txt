	make different types of enemies - stationary - moving - flying - jumping - main style bad guys -- tube pirates?
	clean up game directory
	talking - things you can walk up to and see what they say
	
Make a trigger area that connects to a viewport so the camera can stop moving when a player is a a certain spot

sort out the knock player and give damage functions. it should be either both at once or neither.

make elbows more obvious in player idle animation
